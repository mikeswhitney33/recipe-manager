# Recipe Manager

This is a simple web app for managing a recipe database. 
The server is build using php so to run a local copy just use the following command:
```
php -S <host>:<port>
```
where `<host>` can be replaced with the host address you are using (i.e., localhost, 0.0.0.0, etc.) and `<port>` can be replaced with your desired port (usually something like 8000).
